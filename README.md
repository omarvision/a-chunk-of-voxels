# a-chunk-of-voxels
When making a voxelized world, you have meshes that are groups (or chunks) of voxels at a time. Unity has a limit on the amount of vertices one mesh may contain. When making large voxel worlds you will have to organize you voxels into chunks.  It is also wise to use chunks so that the voxel world is not just one big massive group of voxels but rather workable pieces. In this video see how I organized a group of voxels into one chunk. Also see how I made a first person player, and can walk on the voxels and add, remove voxels with mouse left and right clicks
